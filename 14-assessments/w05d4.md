A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Create a function that takes in the amount of digits as input and find the largest palindrome made from the product of two x-digit numbers.

```
var getLargestPalindrome = function (digits) {

};
```
