## JS Part I
Feel free to use [w3school](http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) or some other website to look for `methods`

1. What are the four common data types you across different languages?
1. What is the method to use to calculate `2 to the power of 2` and `square root of 4`
1. What is the method to use to `round down` and `round up` a float?
1. Name 2 other `methods`, excluding example, that you can use on `Strings`. Example `"hello".charAt(0)`
1. Name 2 other `methods`, excluding example, that you can use on `Arrays`. Example `myArray.toString()`.
1. What are the difference between `null` and `undefined`?

## Bonus

1. Given this array `var cuteAnimals = ["cat", "dog", "hedgehog"]`, write two loops using `xxx.forEach()` and good old fashion `for (var i=0....` to console log `"I love cat"`, `"I love dog"`, and `"I love hedgehog"`.
1. Given an array variable `x` with 2 or more elements, write some code that will swap the first and the last element of `x`.

  ``` javascript
  // This is just an example, your code should work for any array with 2 or more elements
  var x = [1,2,3,4,5];
  //
  // Your code here
  //
  console.log(x);  // should be evaluated as [5,2,3,4,1]
  ```

## JS Part II
1. Write an expression that returns the first element of array `x`
1. Write an expression that returns the last element of array `x`
1. Assume array `x` contains an **odd** number of elements (i.e. its length is an odd number). Write an expression that returns the **MIDDLE** element of the array.
  ``` javascript
  //example
  var x = [8,4,3,9,0,1,4];
  //the expression you write will return 9 in this case
  ```

1. What is the difference between while and do-while?
1. In the following JavaScript code, replace the for loop with a while loop.

  ``` javascript
  var array = "h,e,l,l,o, ,w,o,r,l,d".split(',');
  for (var i = 1; i < array.length; i += 3) {
    var t = array[i-1];
    array[i-1] = array[i];
    array[i] = t;
  }
  ```

## Bonus
In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by `n!`, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example:
![equation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/3/9/939c013423574cad70f33eaa7dd68f0c.png)

Write some JavaScript code to calculate the factorial of `n` and store the answer in a variable called `f`.

  ``` javascript
  var n = 5;   // n can be any integer >= 1
  var f = /* Hint: What should be the initial value of this variable? */
  //
  // Your code here
  //
  console.log(f);
  ```
